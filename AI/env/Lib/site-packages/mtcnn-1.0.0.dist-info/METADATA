## Overview

![Example](resources/result.jpg)

MTCNN is a robust face detection and alignment library implemented for Python >= 3.10 and TensorFlow >= 2.12, designed to detect faces and their landmarks using a multitask cascaded convolutional network. This library improves on the original implementation by offering a complete refactor, simplifying usage, improving performance, and providing support for batch processing.

This library is ideal for applications requiring face detection and alignment, with support for both bounding box and landmark prediction.

## Installation

MTCNN can be installed via pip:

```bash
pip install mtcnn
```

MTCNN requires Tensorflow >= 2.12. This external dependency can be installed manually or automatically along with MTCNN via:

```bash
pip install mtcnn[tensorflow]
```

## Usage Example

```python
from mtcnn import MTCNN
from mtcnn.utils.images import load_image

# Create a detector instance
detector = MTCNN(device="CPU:0")

# Load an image
image = load_image("ivan.jpg")

# Detect faces in the image
result = detector.detect_faces(image)

# Display the result
print(result)
```

Output example:

```json
[
    {
        "box": [277, 90, 48, 63],
        "keypoints": {
            "nose": (303, 131),
            "mouth_right": (313, 141),
            "right_eye": (314, 114),
            "left_eye": (291, 117),
            "mouth_left": (296, 143)
        },
        "confidence": 0.9985
    }
]
```

## Models Overview

MTCNN uses a cascade of three networks to detect faces and facial landmarks:

- **PNet (Proposal Network)**: Scans the image and proposes candidate face regions. 
- **RNet (Refine Network)**: Refines the face proposals from PNet.
- **ONet (Output Network)**: Detects facial landmarks (eyes, nose, mouth) and provides a final refinement of the bounding boxes.

All networks are implemented using TensorFlow’s functional API and optimized to avoid unnecessary operations, such as transpositions, ensuring faster and more efficient execution.
